# IITM-Timetable-Maker

>Currently this project only supports timetable for B.Tech and Dual Degree and is based on [Timetable | Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/academics/academic-services/timetable)

This Project uses Google's [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script).

On Clicking the Submit Button it automatically adds all the classes to your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).

The Project can be accessed at https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzFaVbv8x0lLTn2ZURC36ioHwQpIpCUIswcL1cF4DHSMmT8oajtPZIyJE6tCZSc4Axp_g/exec

>**There is a known issue regarding Apps Script that if a user is signed into multiple accounts. The link might not work. The current workaround is to use incognito.**

Please excuse me for the bad UI as UI wasn't the primary objective of this project. I am always welcome to any UI Improvements.
